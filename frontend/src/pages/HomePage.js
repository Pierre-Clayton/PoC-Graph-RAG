        <h2>Graph RAG Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Graph RAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a cutting-edge approach that integrates graph databases with retrieval augmented generation. By leveraging structured relationships within financial data, this method provides a deeper, context-aware analysis.

          <li>
            <strong>Structured Data Representation:</strong> Models financial data as nodes and edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Context Retrieval:</strong> Extracts relevant, context-linked data points.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Analysis:</strong> Offers interactive graph visualizations and in-depth insights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimized Summarization:</strong> Uses AI to generate detailed analyses based on both direct and indirect relationships.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our application uses a FastAPI backend integrated with a Neo4j graph database and OpenAIâ€™s language models. The balance sheet data from BNP Paribas is transformed into a dynamic knowledge graph, which is then visualized interactively. This end-to-end process ensures that users receive not only raw data but also actionable insights through both classic and graph-based analyses.
